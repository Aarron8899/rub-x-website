    <h1>Rub-X Institutional Hosting Cooperation</h1>
    <div class="notice">
      <strong>Important:</strong> Rub-X will no longer be promoted or licensed commercially. Institutional hosting is now the sole acceptable mode of cooperation. Without a trusted hosting institution, this technology will remain archived.
    </div>

    <h2>What Is Institutional Hosting?</h2>
    <p>Rub-X is a field-ready, low-cost, terrain-adaptable automation system designed to replace hazardous manual rubber tapping. We are seeking one or more responsible institutions to formally host this technology for verification, field trials, and coordinated deployment.</p>
    <p>Hosting does not require purchasing or owning the patent. It entails taking public responsibility for managing, testing, and guiding Rub-X through institutional channels, in line with global sustainability goals.</p>

    <h2>Download Hosting Proposal</h2>
    <p>All details, including hosting responsibilities and scope, are outlined in the PDF below.</p>
