    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This page documents the 3-year international journey of Rub-X (2022–2025), an ultra-low-cost automation system for sustainable natural rubber harvesting. Despite widespread recognition of its innovation, Rub-X has not yet received sufficient institutional or international support.

    <h2>Industry Validation</h2>
    <p>
      Between 2022 and 2025, the Rub-X project proactively engaged with key institutions and stakeholders in the natural rubber industry, including associations, research institutes, and policy-related entities across Asia. Although most responses were informal or not issued as official endorsements, the following institutions either acknowledged the innovation or affirmed its potential through written replies, expert comments, or intermediary feedback:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>China Natural Rubber Association (CNRA)</strong>: Recognized the labor shortage crisis and acknowledged the value of Rub-X.</li>
      <li><strong>Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (CATAS)</strong>: Confirmed technical interest and suggested further feasibility exploration.</li>
      <li><strong>Hainan University Rubber Institute</strong>: Researchers noted Rub-X’s potential and expressed openness to collaboration.</li>
      <li><strong>Confexhub (Malaysia)</strong>: Industry experts confirmed Rub-X as the only known terrain-adaptive automation solution.</li>
      <li><strong>Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (ANRPC)</strong>: Intermediary discussions showed alignment, though no formal support emerged.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These interactions reflect peer-level recognition across key producer regions, though no policy mechanisms have materialized.
    </p>

    <h2>Call for Support</h2>
    <p>
      The Rub-X system is now listed on the <a class="pdf-link" href="https://www.wipo.int/green-technology-database/en/details/6118" target="_blank">WIPO GREEN platform</a>, and initial contact has been made with UNDP and other international bodies. However, no meaningful response or action has followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project has reached a stage where solo advancement is no longer viable. It involves cross-border innovation, global labor dynamics, and sustainable development goals. We urgently call upon U.S. and international agencies, economic development bodies, and fair-minded institutions to step forward and assist in facilitating:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recognition of Rub-X as a strategic, terrain-adaptive green technology</li>
      <li>Supportive international cooperation frameworks</li>
      <li>Deployment and pilot trials in rubber-producing regions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Without timely and fair support, Rub-X — despite its breakthrough nature — may fall into geopolitical ambiguity and institutional neglect.
